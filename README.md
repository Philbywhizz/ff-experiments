# FlashForth Experiments
Experiments and learnings with [FlashForth](https://flashforth.com/) and the ATMega328P microcontroller

This repository contains all my little experiments and forth source code that I have developed for the ATMega328P. I am no expert in forth but feel it would be helpful to have a repository of flashforth code (as I haven't found many examples). Feel free to use these files as you like.

## Setup
My hardware setup is an ATMeta328P microcontroller on a breadboard as outlined [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/standalone). Instead of running the Arduino bootloader I've reflashed the microcontroller with FlashForth and am communicating with it using an FTDI cable.

With this basic setup I can then interface with other modules and components as I experiment.
